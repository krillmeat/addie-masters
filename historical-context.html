            <p>The term &ldquo;interlanguage&rdquo; was coined by Selinker (1972, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 778) as a a term to explain the mental model of language that a second language (L2) learner develops as they acquire their L2. This work was based on Corder&rsquo;s (1967) work in error analysis (Larsen-Freeman & Long, 1991, pp. 58-60) and the development of Chomsky&rsquo;s (1965) theory of Universal Grammar (White, 2020, p. 19). This work is largely situated in the cognitive model of language learning, which gained its popularity between 1970-1980 (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 119), and posits that language development is largely based on the innate mental capacities and models that language learners are born with and then build off of through socialization and education (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 118).</p>
            <p>As methodology evolved, linguists such as Tarone (1982) and Ellis (1983) explored how this mental model of language that exists within the L2er&rsquo;s mind can change based on their social interactions (Song, 2020). Such theories include the theory of interlanguage variability (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779) which explores how interlanguage can vary between students depending upon a myriad of factors, not limited to social and psychological context and systematic variability (Ellis, 1983, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 780) that posits that some interlanguage variability between students can be anticipated by studying the situational, contextual, and psychological contexts of language use.</p>

            <p>The study of interlanguage and likewise, interlanguage variability, has had large and continued impacts to the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA). These impacts are most notably an explanation and recognition of the value of student errors (Corder, 1967), heightened awareness of the spectrum of language development that exists between the L1 “start-line” and the “finish-line” that is total acquisition of a learner&rsquo;s L2 (Selinker, 1972, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 778) and the ways that educators can leverage and account for social context to better understand learner development (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779).</p>
            <p>Since the development of interlanguage variability, language teachers have better insight into how to leverage social interaction to improve a student&rsquo;s L2 progress and likewise how the social context of language use can inhibit the development of a healthy interlanguage (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779). This creates a more well-rounded and learner-centric field that acknowledges both psychological and social factors to learning and encourages new explorations in teaching methodology.</p>

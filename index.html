            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <div class='sub-section' data-heading=''>
              <p>The term &ldquo;interlanguage&rdquo; was coined by Selinker<sup cite='1972, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 778'>1</sup> <span class='hide-cite'>(1972, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 778)</span> as a term to explain the mental model of language that a second language (L2) learner develops as they acquire their L2. This work was based on Corder&rsquo;s (1967) work in error analysis (Larsen-Freeman & Long, 1991, pp. 58-60) and the development of Chomsky&rsquo;s (1965) theory of Universal Grammar (White, 2020, p. 19). This work is largely situated in the cognitive model of language learning, which gained its popularity between 1970-1980 (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 119), and posits that language development is largely based on the innate mental capacities and models that language learners are born with and then build off of through socialization and education (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 118).</p>
              <p>As methodology evolved, linguists such as Tarone (1982) and Ellis (1983) explored how this mental model of language that exists within the L2er&rsquo;s mind can change based on their social interactions (Song, 2020). Such theories include the theory of interlanguage variability (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779) which explores how interlanguage can vary between students depending upon a myriad of factors, not limited to social and psychological context and systematic variability (Ellis, 1983, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 780) that posits that some interlanguage variability between students can be anticipated by studying the situational, contextual, and psychological contexts of language use.</p>

              <h4>Impact to Second Language Acquisition (SLA)</h4>
              <p>The study of interlanguage and likewise, interlanguage variability, has had large and continued impacts to the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA). These impacts are most notably an explanation and recognition of the value of student errors (Corder, 1967), heightened awareness of the spectrum of language development that exists between the L1 “start-line” and the “finish-line” that is total acquisition of a learner&rsquo;s L2 (Selinker, 1972, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 778) and the ways that educators can leverage and account for social context to better understand learner development (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779).</p>
              <p>Since the development of interlanguage variability, language teachers have better insight into how to leverage social interaction to improve a student&rsquo;s L2 progress and likewise how the social context of language use can inhibit the development of a healthy interlanguage (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779). This creates a more well-rounded and learner-centric field that acknowledges both psychological and social factors to learning and encourages new explorations in teaching methodology.</p>

            <h3>Presentation of Topic</h3>
            <div class='sub-section' data-heading=''>
              <p>Given the general concept of interlanguage as a bridge between a learner&rsquo;s L1 and L2, interlanguage variability refers to the times in interlanguage development where the linguistic “rules” of the L1 and L2 are in conflict, and the learner might use multiple different variations of language to express the same phenomenon (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779). This can be considered similarly to the saying “there are multiple paths to the top of the mountain.”</p>
              <p>The notion here is that a learner&rsquo;s interlanguage is a very personal construction: even if two learners start with the same Native Language (NL) and are aiming at the same Target Language (TL), it is not certain that their interlanguages (IL) throughout the learning process will be even remotely similar. This is explained largely by the impact of social context to the development of this interlanguage (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96). That is, should the language learner be exposed to different forms of language, in different sequences, or in different social situations, their produced language might vary significantly as they respond to these external factors (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96).</p>
              <p>A good example of the social context of speech impacting interlanguage variation is a learner performing in a planned verbal assessment for a language class versus a learner speaking with friends in their TL, during a day outing. Of course, these are two drastically different social contexts and each presents their own unique form of variation to the linguistic display.</p>
              <p>In the case of the planned verbal assessment, such factors as psychological context (referring to the time that the learner has to prepare their speech before speaking) (Song, 2020, p. 780) and situational context (referring to the formality of a standardized assessment) (Song, 2020, p. 780) vary significantly from an outing with friends. Thus if the learner is attempting to make a point about the weather, their interlanguage (given that they have not fully mastered the L2) might be more artificial and “accurate” in the case of a formal assessment, and more expressive (colloquial), expansive, and “inaccurate” during an outing with friends (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
              <p>Tarone (1979, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96) initially explained this as a “chameleon” phenomenon, in which the language learner cannot control the way that they shift styles in order to match the linguistic environment in which they&rsquo;ve been placed. However, Larsen-Freeman (2019, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019) questions learner agency &mdash; in which learners knowingly and intentionally alter their speech and linguistic style to either match or stand out from their linguistic environment (p. 96).</p>
              <p>While the adoption of certain styles of language might be intentional, unbeknownst to these learners, they are continually internalizing this information as part of their interlanguage (Lantolf & Beckett, 2009, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 97). That is, Lantolf & Beckett (2009, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019) posit that learners do not acquire language in a vacuum, like sterile language skills within a textbook, but instead that learners integrate the skills themselves as well as the social contexts, features, and styles associated with those skills into their interlanguage (p. 97).  This notion is similar to the feeling of nostalgia &mdash; the idea that a song or film might “take you back” &mdash; similarly a learner might resurrect social contexts or learned styles of language as associated with their developing interlanguage (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 97-98).</p>
            </div>
            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Significance to Education'>
              <p>Tarone&rsquo;s (1982, as cited in Song, 2020) application of this logic suggests that educators should be aware of how the social context might impact student performance, and create a variety of social situations for students to interact in, in order to expand their interlanguage (p. 779). Additionally, in the pursuit of a variety, teachers should pay extra attention to how their students are responding to such situations, in order to “check and adjust” their methods to fit the learner's needs (Song, 2020, pp. 781-782).</p>
              <p>This understanding of social context as a key factor in student progress represents a historical shift from language learning as being learner agnostic, in the case of behaviorist theory, gradually toward attention to the learner as main change agent in their own L2 development (Larsen-Freeman, 2019, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96). This paves the way for new and exciting developments in how learners can acquire language, and additions to the pedagogical toolkit for encouraging language development, such as in the case of exemplar-based learning (Ellis & Wulff, 2020) as described below.</p>

          <div class='main-section' data-heading='Inquiries & Research Questions'>
            <h3>Inquiries &amp; Research Questions</h3>
            <p>The following research questions loosely dictate the direction of the study of interlanguage variation and summarize the inquiries that have developed this theory:</p>
            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Social Context'>
              <h4>How does social context influence the development of a learner&rsquo;s interlanguage?</h4>
              <p>In his work to define and elucidate on the topic of interlanguage variability, Ellis (1992, as cited in Song, 2020, pp. 779-781) created the model of interlanguage variability, which breaks the topic down to two categories: systematic and non-systematic variability:</p>
              <h5>Systematic Variability</h5>
              <p>Within the realm of systematic variability, both situational and psycholinguistic contexts are largely a reflection of social factors to the development of interlanguage (Song, 2020, p. 780). Situational context refers to the continuum that accounts for “style-shifting” &mdash; that is, the scenarios by which learners feel they should more or less accurately perform based on the context of the language use (Song, 2020, p. 780). Psycholinguistic variability refers to those various situations that allow learners for more (or less) time and planning to produce language (Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
              <p>An example of this is a controlled classroom setting, where students have a lengthy time to prepare their speech before using it, versus a spontaneous discussion with another speaker of the target language, on the street. The first scenario creates a much larger opportunity for students to plan and anticipate their language use than the second, which likely would reveal greater accuracy in the classroom than on the street.</p>
              <h5>Non-Systematic Variability</h5>
              <p>Non-systematic variability accounts for those variations in interlanguage development that appear to occur at random in student performance &mdash; these are phenomena like random mistakes and performance variability (Song, 2020, p. 780). Performance variability describes the errors in speech that learners can make as a result of social pressures and accompanying student variations that reflect varying levels of discomfort in displaying knowledge and thus “performing” in front of an audience (Song, 2020, p. 780). These factors include slips of the tongue, changes of mind, and more (Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
              <p>The breakdown of systematic and non-systematic variability can be seen in the table, below:</p>
              <img src=''/>
            </div>
            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='In the Classroom'>
              <h4>How do learners display developing interlanguage in the classroom?</h4>
              <p>Learners demonstrate the development of interlanguage in the classroom through errors that can be exemplified in the understanding of “U-shaped development.” Given that Selinker (1972) proposed the interlanguage as a method for understanding and examining student errors, based on Corder&rsquo;s (1967) error analysis (White, 2020, p. 19), it is clear that errors should be the first line of inquiry for understanding how a student&rsquo;s interlanguage is growing (Corder, 1967, p. 167).</p>
              <p>Kellerman (1985) goes on to posit that the growth of an interlanguage is not a linear process from points A to B, but instead that student progress undergoes a “U-shape” as they negotiate meaning between their native and target languages (p. 345). Thus, teachers should consider that in language development, errors are a sign of progress and the development of interlanguage (Corder, 1967, p. 166-167). However, the frequency and type of errors should not solely be attributed to student development, but should be analyzed critically on a case-by-case basis to ensure that there are not extraneous social factors, as described by Tarone (1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779), that can be controlled and manipulated in the classroom to positively impact or even accelerate student performance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Contectual Impact'>
              <h4>Can social context impact the display of a learner&rsquo;s interlanguage?</h4>
              <p>Absolutely. Social context both in and outside of the classroom can impact a learner&rsquo;s developing interlanguage, as described below:</p>
              <h5>Within the Classroom</h5>
              <p>Within the classroom, factors such as task-and mode-type (face-to-face versus computer-mediated) (Kim, 2017), as well as the learner&rsquo;s affective variables, such as attitude, emotion, and behavior, all of which can be influenced by the social situation (Song, 2020, p. 782) can impact the ways that learners display their interlanguage and the frequency of errors that they make. These factors described above are simply a reflection of Ellis&rsquo;s (1983) model of systematic variability (Song, 2020, p. 780) and are further described above. Thus, it is the role and responsibility of the teacher to understand which factors within their classroom seem to elicit a safe opportunity for learners to make errors and thus display their developing interlanguage.</p>
              <h5>Outside of the Classroom</h5>
              <p>Outside of the classroom, larger social forces are at work, including topics of cultural assimilation (Callahan, 2017), generational traumas (Callahan, 2017), and language exposure (Xu, 2018). In the case of study abroad, described by Xu (2018), students who were encouraged to take a “language pledge” to adopt or speak their target language for the majority of their study abroad experience made larger strides in language development than students who did not. Additionally, in Callahan&rsquo;s (2017) description of generational interlanguage development, social factors such as systemic racism and bias against language adoption impact the way that speakers adopt (or do not adopt) their target language.</p>

                  <h5>Noam Chomsky</h5>
                  <p>Noam Chomsky is one of the most respected and seminal theorists in linguistics (MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, 2002). He has made his rounds at some of the most prestigious universities in the world, and is now a Laureate Professor of Linguistics at Arizona State University and Institute Professor Emeritus at MIT (Wikipedia, 2022).</p>
                  <h6>Contribution to Interlanguage Variability</h6>
                  <p>Chomsky&rsquo;s work in cognitive linguistics and the subsequent development of Universal Grammar (UG) in 1965 is the precursor to the theory of interlanguage (White, 2020, p. 19) and continually serves as a baseline theory of linguistic development.</p>

                  <h6>Contribution to Interlanguage Variability</h6>
                  <p>Corder (1967) introduced the concept of error analysis to explain the importance of studying student errors as a signal of their language acquisition (p. 167). This work was the main inspiration to Larry Selinker&rsquo;s research in language acquisition and fundamental to the development of interlanguage theory, which explains learner errors as a signal of their developing interlanguage (Larsen-Freeman & Long, 1991, pp. 58-60).</p>

Selinker has an esteemed academic resume, which includes three-times as a Fulbright Scholar (Wikipedia, 2022), where he studied alongside Pit Corder at the University of Edinburgh (MOBILLE Lycée Français De New York, 2019).</p>
                  <h6>Contribution to Interlanguage Variability</h6>
                  <p>Selinker is most notable for his development of the theory of interlanguage in 1972, which seeks to explain the “spectrum” of language that exists in a learner&rsquo;s mind as they acquire a second language (Larsen-Freeman & Long, 1991, p. 60). This makes him the most important theorist to the topic of interlanguage, regardless of the additional variables of social context.</p>

                  <h5>Eric Kellerman</h5>
                  <p>“Eric Kellerman is a Reader in the departments of English and Applied Linguistics at the University of Nijmegen,” (Google Play, 2014). His work pertaining to Second Language Acquisition (SLA) has been published in numerous academic journals, such as Second Language Research and Studies in Second Language Acquisition (Google Play, 2014).</p>
                  <h6>Contribution to Interlanguage Variability</h6>
                  <p>In his contribution to Interlanguage Theory, Kellerman (1985) proposed the concept of U-Shaped Development, which seeks to explain the trajectory of learner performance during second language acquisition (p. 345). According to this hypothesis, as a learner develops and refines their interlanguage, their L2 performance follows a “U” shape, which can be impacted by the social context of their performance (Kellerman, 1985, p. 352-353).</p>

              <h4>Sub-Issues and Important Hypotheses</h4>
              <h5>Universal Grammer (UG)</h5>
              <p>Noam Chomsky proposed Universal Grammar (UG) as a part of the cognitive movement in linguistics, to explain how children acquire their first language (White, 2020, p. 19). This theory proposed that children are born with an innate sense of grammatical rules that dictate in what way, how quickly, and in what order they develop language (White, 2020, p. 19).</p>
              <p>Though it is conceptually very different from the study of interlanguage and even more extremely disparate from interlanguage variability and the discussion of social context, UG is largely the foundation for counter-theories such as Selinker&rsquo;s “interlanguage” (White, 2020, p. 19).</p>
              <h5>Fossilization</h5>
              <p>The discussion of fossilization is one of the key arguments that the phenomenon of interlanguage must answer for (Larsen-Freeman & Long, 1991, p. 60). Fossilization argues that there are certain theories and traits in a learner&rsquo;s target language (TL) that they will never master, and will instead retain the parallel traits of their native language (NL) regardless of the amount of instruction or outside help that a learner receives (Selinker, as cited in Larsen-Freeman & Long, 1991, p. 60).</p>
              <p>Fossilization, however, is not a notion that just appears out of thin air, nor is it something that is outside of a learner (or educator&rsquo;s) control. Instead, fossilization regularly occurs in cases when a learner has been left to use language in a certain way, without receiving contrary input or instruction (Ortega, 2009, pp. 134-135). Likewise, fossilization appears at times when a learner has not been encouraged to grow their language acquisition outside of their social situation, and thus the skills that they have developed “fossilize” and become harder to correct the longer they are left alone (Ortega, 2009, pp. 134).</p>

                <p class='video-note'><span class='embolden'>Video Note:</span> This clip presents a valuable discussion on the influence of interlanguage, fossilization, and translanguaging, however, for the purpose of this discussion, focus on information developed from 3:32-4:31.</p>
              </div>
              <h5>U-Shaped Development</h5>
              <p>U-shaped development was proposed by Kellerman (1985) to describe the process by which learner&rsquo;s acquire language and make sense of new language rules as part of their interlanguage. According to Kellerman (1985), learner acquisition of new linguistic input follows a “U-shape” as it is integrated into their interlanguage (p. 345).</p>
              <p>At the top of the “U,” a learner is aware of new language rules and artificially replicates these rules into their speech, giving the illusion of mastery (Kellerman, 1985, p. 345). As the learner actually makes sense of these rules and compares them by their current interlanguage and knowledge of their NL, they “backtrack” and seem to lose this mastery (Kellerman, 1985, p. 345). Finally, after significant use, the learner indeed acquires this new language and organically integrates it into their interlanguage, and their accuracy improves, completing the “U-shape” (Kellerman, 1985, p. 345).</p>
              <h5>Error(s)</h5>
              <p>Corder (1967) suggests that errors are a reflection of a learner&rsquo;s implicit knowledge of language and can be used to map their transitional competence (p. 166). This theory is split into two camps: errors of performance, which are unsystematic, and errors of competence, which are systematic and can be evidenced to provide valuable linguistic information to the teacher, researcher, and the learner (Corder, 1967, p. 166).</p>
              <h6>The Value of Errors</h6>
              <p>For teachers, errors are indicative of the progress that a learner has made and what is left to learn (Corder, 1967, p. 167); to the researcher, errors display the ways that learners acquire language and what strategies they use to learn (Corder, 1967, p. 167); and finally to learners, errors are indicative of the progress that they have left to make and opportunities for improvement (Corder, 1967, p. 167). This attitude toward errors as informative and indicative of both progress and opportunity is foundational to the understanding of interlanguage.</p>
              <h5>Behaviorism</h5>
              <p>Behaviorism was the linguistic movement that reigned supreme in the 1940s and 1950s (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 118) and is responsible for language learning models such as the audiolingual and fundamental skills methods (Corder, 1967, p. 163). The foundation of behaviorism is that language learning is simply a process of building habits and that linguistic transfer, likewise, is just L1 habits influencing L2 learning (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 118).</p>
              <h6>Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH)</h6>
              <p>This movement is the foundation for Lado&rsquo;s (1957) Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis, which argues that educators and linguists can approximate which language skills a learner might struggle to acquire by uncovering the differences between the L1 and L2 (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 118).</p>
              <h5>Cognitive Approach</h5>
              <p>The cognitive approach followed behaviorism as the prominent theory of learning in the 1970s and 1980s (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 119) and was largely a reaction to the notion that transfer is simply a set of habits that the learner acquires (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 118). Instead, cognitivism suggests that the learner can make decisions about what should be transferred to their L2, as a reflection of their social models (Gass, 2000, as cited in Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 119).</p>
              <h5>Transfer</h5>
              <p>The notion of transfer is a key pillar of the theory of interlanguage and describes the “process through which L2 learners develop interlanguage skills by activating and using previous knowledge,” (Faerch & Kasper, 1987, as cited in Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 120). Selinker (1983) argues that transfer can be broken into positive transfer, which describes scenarios where L1 knowledge facilitates L2 learning and negative transfer, that refers to scenarios where L1 knowledge actually inhibits L2 learning (Karim & Nassaji, 2013, p. 119).</p>
              <h6>Cross-Linguistic Influence (CLI)</h6>
              <p>As an extension of the notion of transfer, Selinker (1992) suggests that cross-linguistic influence (CLI) is a more symbiotic process where the native language intersects with a learner&rsquo;s target language and combines with those universal properties described in Chomsky&rsquo;s (1965) Universal Grammar to build this “interlanguage” bridge between the L1 and L2 (Yi, 2012, p. 2372).</p>
              <h5>Style-Shifting</h5>
              <p>Style-shifting is a key argument in the conversation around social impact to interlanguage development, and describes how learners can shift their linguistic style to meet the social context of a particular situation (Song, 2020, p. 780). Given that vernacular styles themselves are so complex, inexperienced learners cannot just style-shift at a whim, but instead must be aware of their social situation and mature enough in their grasp of their L2 to accommodate the changes to their linguistic style (Song, 2020, p. 780). Tarone (1982, as cited in Song, 2020) “suggests a style-continuum ranging from the vernacular style to the careful style in accordance of the demands of the situation,” (p. 780).</p>
              <h5>Exemplar-Based Learning</h5>
              <p>Though it is technically a connectionist theory of learning, there are numerous connections between exemplar-based learning and the notion of interlanguage variability and social context. The general theory of exemplar-based learning is that language learners have a set of “catch-all” logic-based skills and foundations that, when paired with significant social input, allow them to quickly make sense of, and ultimately acquire language skills (Ibbotson & Tomasello, 2016, p. 72).</p>
              <p>Exemplar-based learning is reliant on the learner&rsquo;s ability to create “prototypes” based on generalizing the input that they have learned and to likewise use these prototypes to build out generalized language skills (Ellis & Wulff, 2020, p. 67-68). Expanding on this subject is the notion of associative learning, which argues that the stronger these prototypical connections are, the more quickly a learner can acquire their L2 (Ellis & Wulff, 2020, p. 61).</p>

              <h4>Changes in Interlanguage Complexity during Study Abroad: A Meta-Analysis</h4>
              <p class='author-name'>Yiran Xu (2018)</p>
              <a href='#' class='article-link'>Read the Article</a>
              <p>In this meta-analysis, Xu (2018) reviews a collection of 30 studies of progress in language complexity of students studying abroad between 4 weeks and 4 months. The goal of this study is to understand how and to what extent interlanguage complexity increases in learners during study abroad, and what factors influence this change (Xu, 2018, p. 199).</p>
              <p>Xu (2018) posits that by analyzing the impact of variations such as “age, L2 proficiency, and length of stay,” (p. 200) on progress toward interlanguage complexity during study abroad, linguists can better “establish a common ground for the understanding of language learning in [Study Abroad] SA contexts,” (p. 200).</p>
              <p>Data was collected through a robust literature search that included both published and unpublished studies from seven sourcing channels. This data was then vetted by a series of nine screening criteria, in order to ensure that there were no extraneous variables that could impact the compiled results (Xu, 2018, p. 202). These criteria included such rules as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>“Language complexity had to be treated as a dependent variable that describes learners&rsquo; interlanguage,” (Xu, 2018, p. 202).</li>
                <li>“The study had to utilize analytic measures to gauge complexity development,” (Xu, 2018, p. 202).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The collected data was then coded based on “learner demographics, SA contextual features, and outcome measures,” (Xu, 2018, p. 203) and synthesized to suggest the following results.</p>
              <h5>Findings and Results</h5>
              <p>Though this study is only a meta-analysis and does not collect its own unique data, the cross-referencing of 30 studies that measure language change during study abroad reveals the impact of direct language exposure to language acquisition, and further studies how this type of socialization of the target language outside of the classroom yields better results to the learner.</p>
              <p>Specifically, Xu (2018) found that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Learner interlanguage complexity does increase during study abroad, however collected data shows that the increase in complexity is minimal.</span> Aggregated data shows that linguistic and syntactic complexity increase marginally during study abroad, however there is a much more significant increase in language fluency during short studies abroad (Xu, 2018, p. 208). Xu (2018) argues that while the study measures complexity in this case, fluency is just as valuable to the language learner, as is cultural assimilation and regaining of the “self” within the new adopted culture (p. 208).</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>In the case of learner demographics, study abroad “show[s] a clear advantage for intermediate-level learners… over advanced learners,” (Xu, 2018, p. 205) however this is likely impacted by the course-types that these learners have taken.</span> Additionally, Xu (2018) posits that study-abroad for a short period of time does not seem to improve linguistic complexity (p. 208). However, students that took a “language pledge” at the start of their program, to exclusively use their target language, made larger gains in their linguistic complexity (Xu, 2018, p. 208).</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Outcome measures to the effect of “language complexity” can be broken down into a number of subcategories that more accurately paints the picture of where the most improvement was made.</span> Xu (2018) breaks down language complexity to lexical and syntactic complexities and then oral and written complexities (p. 206). Learners made the most progress in oral modality and the least in syntactic complexity (Xu, 2018, p. 208).</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Xu (2018) acknowledged consistency in reporting sample size, learner age, and home country during samples, and majority reporting on L1 background, L2 proficiency, and living arrangements.</span> However, under half of these studies reported the amount of language exposure that learners encountered during study abroad, “language proficiency criteria,” (Xu, 2018, p. 207), and finally the intensity of language instruction that learners received.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Contribution to Theory</h5>
              <p>While theorists like Kellerman (1985) and Tarone (1982, as cited in Song, 2020) observe the change in interlanguage based on a variety of social factors, studies and meta-analyses such as this prove the validity of these statements.</p>
              <p>In this meta-analysis, Xu (2018) demonstrates the numerous varying factors that contribute to the development of interlanguage, and analyze how interlanguage can develop non-linearly, in that the progress of one aspect of language (fluency) might grow at a faster rate than another (complexity) based on the constraints of the social situation.</p>

              <h4>Effect of Modality and Task-Type on Interlanguage Variation</h4>
              <p class='author-name'>Hye Yong Kim (2017)</p>
              <a href='#' class='article-link'>Read the Article</a>
              <p>In this study, Kim (2017) seeks to understand how the mode of instruction impacts the second language (L2) performance of the student. In particular, Kim (2017) focuses on the different effects of synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) versus face-to-face (F2F) communication over a range of task-types.</p>
              <p>Kim&rsquo;s (2017) hypothesis is that such modality does have varying effects on L2 performance, and one mode of communication does promote better L2 performance. Kim (2017) tested this hypothesis by analyzing the effect of “spot-the-difference, decision-making, and story-sequencing,” tasks (p. 223) on learner accuracy specifically in question forms and article production (pp. 230-231).</p>
              <p>In the course of this study, data was collected through observing “20 intermediate-level ESL students… from three ESL classrooms at a large public midwestern university,” that represented four different L1s and ranged from 22-35 years old (Kim, 2017, p. 223). Participation was vetted through a questionnaire that inquired into computer-based habits such as computer use, familiarity with typing, and time per day spent on the computer (Kim, 2017, p. 223).</p>
              <p>Learners were paired and asked to complete all three tasks for each mode (SCMC and F2F, totaling six tasks) in random order over 90 minutes (Kim, 2017, p. 224) and analyzed to deliver the following results:</p>
              <h5>Findings and Results</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><span class='embolden'>There is no one mode of communication that better promotes L2 performance than the other, but instead that various modes of communication, be it SCMC or F2F, can be leveraged based on the teacher&rsquo;s educational goals (Kim, 2017, p. 232).</span> Kim (2017) remarks that “the mode of communication affects the nature of the interaction,” (p. 230) and thus that if a teacher is trying to build a combination of linguistic and paralinguistic competency, F2F interaction yields better results, whereas SCMC yields more advanced linguistic competency, however paralinguistic cues are completely absent from the students&rsquo; repertoire (Kim, 2017, p. 230).</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>In use of articles, students are more accurate in text-based SCMC than F2F communication (Kim, 2017, p. 232).</span> Additionally, it is suggested that that accuracy in SCMC communication is largely based on the lack of paralinguistic cues, making it paramount that students produce more accurate and advanced language to prevent confusion (Kim, 2017, p. 232).</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Modality type does not necessarily make a large impact to L2 performance, however resoundingly the task-type is influential in this way (Kim, 2017, p. 231-232).</span> In particular, “spot-the difference” tasks perform best for learner accuracy, whereas decision-making tasks perform the worst, specifically in an SCMC environment (Kim, 2017, p. 231).</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Contribution to Theory</h5>
              <p>By examining the different impacts of synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) and face-to-face (F2F) interaction to interlanguage performance, Kim (2017) is actively contributing data to the discussion of which modes of instruction are most valuable to second-language instruction, and at which points in the learner&rsquo;s development. This study gives tangible examples and realistic data to support using certain task-types over different modes in order to encourage teachers to positively impact a student&rsquo;s developing interlanguage.</p>

              <h4>Interlanguage and Cross-Generational Assimilation: Past-Tense Unmarking in Hispanicized English</h4>
              <p class='author-name'>Erin Callahan (2017)</p>
              <a href='#' class='article-link'>Read the Article</a>
              <p>In this article, Callahan (2017) examines language variation and interlanguage development between multiple generations in North Town, Texas and cross-references these with similar interlanguage development in middle-schoolers in Durham, North Carolina. This data exposes the generational change to second language (English) adoption and the social factors that influence such adoption (or lack thereof) throughout generations of migrants to the United States.</p>
              <p>Data was collected through conversations between researchers and residents in North Town, TX as well as students in Durham, NC (Callahan, 2017). Interview results from North Town, a town in Texas that is approximately two hours from the Mexican border, lays home to approximately “four generations of Spanish-speaking residents,” (Callahan, 2017, p. 108) were compared with those from Durham, NC, which is home to a much more recent influx of Spanish-speaking residents, thus “representing only one or two generations,” (Callahan, 2017, p. 110).</p>
              <p>Ultimately, this data was coded based on verb class and past tense unmarking (Callahan, 2017, p. 103), and this analysis was used to understand the deeper social implications of interlanguage development on Hispanic communities in the United States, reflected in the following results:</p>
              <h5>Findings and Results</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Speakers can manipulate and maintain their ability to learn the target language, based on the social context of the language itself.</span> Callahan (2017) reviews numerous reasons why structural changes in language (and interlanguage) can appear across generations of ESL speakers (pp. 122-123). These structural changes are largely indicative of an attitudinal change to the production of English language across generations (Callahan, 2017, p. 123). This is exhibited in the collected data from both North Town and Durham. In their discussion of results, Callahan (2017) remarks that “a casualty of shifting social consciousness: from the &lsquo;we versus them&rsquo; mentality of a market minority community… to the more integrated, less bilingual generation which has assimilated to supralocal (English) norms,” (p. 122). That is, changes in language use and rate of assimilation to the target language are a direct reflection of the change of attitude to the “cultural, ethnic, and linguistic homogeneity versus heterogeneity in the speech setting,” (Callahan, 2017, p. 122).</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Callahan (2017) finds that certain variability disappears between generations in both Durham, NC and North Town, TX.</span> This is particularly apparent in the disappearance of the unmarking variable between first and second generations of Hispanic residents in the United States (Callahan, 2017, p. 119). Between one to five years, students transition from being largely Spanish-dominant speakers that struggle with English to being English-dominant speakers that can and only will speak Spanish in limited scenarios (Callahan, 2017, p. 122).</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Contribution to Theory</h5>
              <p>Callahan (2017) bridges the divide between a psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic study of interlanguage and draws hypotheses on language assimilation across generations by examining the developing interlanguage of speakers in Texas and North Carolina. This makes a large impact to the field of second-language acquisition (SLA) by showing how these fields can exist in symbiosis to one another and how theories and data that are gathered through a psycholinguistic lens can be translated to explain sociolinguistic phenomena.</p>
              <p>Though this type of study has been done before, and few contemporary linguists believe that either field exists in a vacuum, this type of study is impactful in its own right, by drawing connections between disparate theories to prove a richer hypothesis.</p>

          <div class='main-section' data-heading='Discussion'>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>To return to Ellis&rsquo;s (1992, as cited in Song, 2020) breakdown of interlanguage variability, there are ultimately five categories that numerous variations of interlanguage can fall within, a few of which (situational, contextual, psycholinguistic, and performance variability) are disproportionately influenced by the social situation in which the learner is placed (p. 780). Ultimately, the goal of interlanguage variability is to prove and explain why the development of interlanguage is not strictly linear, and why performance in language acquisition can fluctuate between students and scenarios (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779).</p>
            <img src=''/>
            <p>The following examples portray the varying ways that interlanguage variability can be manifested in and outside of the classroom. Given the nature of interlanguage variability and social context, there are numerous combinations of factors that can result in the development of interlanguage, and each of the examples has been chosen to represent a single unique “angle” on this discussion. In summary, those “angles” are as follows:</p>

              <h4>Impact of Error Awareness to Interlanguage Development</h4>
              <p>In this example, Bryfonski & Sanz (2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020) show a negotiated meaning of the word “translated” between native and non-native Spanish speakers (p. 204). As shown below, the non-native speaker (NNS) recognizes a gap in their own understanding (and thus, their interlanguage) in the word “translated,” and seeks help from their native speaking (NS) conversational partner (Bryfonski & Sanz, 2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204).</p>
              <p>This example was originally presented as evidence of Language-Related Episodes (LREs), where learners become explicitly aware of their own language mistakes and make an effort to remedy it (Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 203), however the subsequent conversation between the NS and NNS provides a great opportunity to begin with just the “pieces” of error analysis (Corder, 1967, p. 167), and bridge these errors into a more holistic understanding of the NNS, their developing interlanguage (Kellerman, 1985, p. 345), and ultimately their response to the social situation and how this might impact their learning (Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>

              <h5>Discussion</h5>
              <p>In the above example, the NNS recognizes a gap in their own knowledge and seeks explicit feedback and correction from their conversational partner (Bryfonski & Sanz, 2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204). The preceding “back-and-forth” conversation between the speakers demonstrates how the speakers have recognized the gap between their own interlanguages and use this as an opportunity to construct a shared meaning of the word “translated” in context (Bryfonski & Sanz, 2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204).</p>
              <p>This example is not only a great demonstration of negotiated meaning and explicit feedback (Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204) but also presents an exciting opportunity to leverage Corder&rsquo;s (1967) error analysis (pp. 166-167) to better understand the gaps in the NNS&rsquo;s interlanguage. Given that this example is intentionally broad, and does not specifically assign a correlation between the conversation and interlanguage (Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204), there is a new opportunity to dig deeper into this theory to better understand the process of pulling results from the lens of error analysis to a larger discussion of interlanguage.</p>
              <h5>Connecting Data to Theory</h5>
              <p>To first understand the relationship between the error made by the NNS (Bryfonski & Sanz, 2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204) and the connection to their interlanguage, it is important to classify this error based on Corder&rsquo;s (1967) distinction between errors of performance and errors of competence (p. 166). Given that this error is recognized by the NS and feedback is then elicited by the NNS, as the error continues (in the repetition of “¿traslados?”) (Bryfonski & Sanz, 2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204), one can assume that this is not an unsystematic and otherwise “random” error of performance, but instead a more systematic error of competence, which Corder (1967) remarks are particularly valuable to understand what the learner knows so far, has yet to learn, and the strategies that they employ in order to reach the mastery of their Target Language (TL) (p. 167).</p>
              <p>Next, one should consider this error as part of the “U-shape” of the NNS&rsquo;s interlanguage development (Kellerman, 1985, p. 345). This error was made in conversation, as the learner (otherwise confidently) completes their sentence (Bryfonski & Sanz, 2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204), meaning that the word “translated” alone is the interlanguage gap, and that it is likely that the learner has learned the term “traducidas” prior to this conversation, but is confusing it with the word “traslados” as this closer aligns to the English sound of “translated.” Thus, as described by Kellerman (1985) in the discussion of the “U-shape,” this is indicative of the “dip” on the interlanguage suspension bridge, as the learner contextualizes lessons-learned of the L2, and attempts to make sense of them in relation to their L1 (p. 345).</p>
              <p>Finally, given that we have established that this error is a result of the NNS&rsquo;s developing interlanguage between English (L1) and Spanish (L2), then we can posit further that this is an interlanguage variation based on situational context (Song, 2020, p. 780). Situational context refers to scenarios where a learner might be more or less aware of their accuracy, based on the social situation that they are in (Song, 2020, p. 780). Given that this NNS is explicitly requesting feedback from the NS – their choice to do so is likely a reflection of the social situation.</p>
              <h5>Implications in the Classroom</h5>
              <p>This example above is a great litmus for the types of errors that educators might encounter as they observe and assess students in the classroom (Bryfonski & Sanz, 2018, as cited in Gass & Mackey, 2020, p. 204) and likewise, the opportunities to connect these errors to a better understanding of student interlanguage and varying factors that could influence its change. Given that this type of “quick analysis” is possible, educators have an opportunity to put on the hat of “researcher” and “observer” in the classroom, and thus encourage new scenarios where they can tease out varying social impacts to interlanguage.</p>
              <p>Additionally, this type of self-awareness and request for feedback is a sign of a student who understands the opportunity that their errors present for additional learning and language growth. This is clearly a student who is comfortable in their social setting and is not heavily impacted by performance variability, which might create new errors, simply out of “nerves” (Song, 2020, p. 780). For the teacher, this is also a great example of a “safe” social situation, and can serve as a model for the type of environment that they should cultivate in the classroom, to empower students to freely make mistakes and seek correction for their own growth.</p>

            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Effect of Task-Type'>
              <h4>Effect of Task-Type on Interlanguage Variation</h4>
              <p>In this example, researchers contrast a synchronous computer-mediated conversation (SCMC) and face-to-face (F2F) conversation between learners, as they attempt to work together to complete a “spot-the-difference” task. This is a particularly salient example of interlanguage variation, simply due to the difference in complexity between learner sentences, as they adapt to the demands of changing social situations.</p>
              <p>This data is part of a larger research effort to analyze the effect of computer-mediated development on second-language learners (SLLs). Cheon and Lily are two of twenty participants chosen from three intermediate-level ESL courses, from a variety of native languages (Kim, 2017,  p. 224). To complete these activities, participants were paired off into dyads and asked to complete a series of tasks, both through SCMC, which can be described as a computer-mediated “chat” back and forth, and F2F, where speakers are physically in the room together and can communicate to complete a task.</p>
              <div class='excerpt-wrap'><img src='MEDIA/Excerpts/example_five.png'/></div>
              <p class='excerpt-note'>(Kim, 2017, p. 228)</p>
              <h5>Discussion</h5>
              <p>This is a really interesting example of the difference between face-to-face (F2F) and synchronous computer-mediated conversation (SCMC) in reference to a spot-the-difference task. On the surface, it can be gleaned that there is significantly less language production overall in the F2F interaction, as well as significantly less complex and less sophisticated sentence structure, than in the SCMC example. Shockingly, these examples were collected within 90 minutes of one another, from the same learners (Kim, 2017, pp. 224-225).</p>
              <p>Though this could be used as an argument against the theory of interlanguage (e.g. how can these learners develop their interlanguage but perform so differently?), Kim (2017) posits that instead this is an example of how the display of interlanguage might vary in response to a social situation. This example suggests that learners actually use the minimum viable language features that are required to accomplish the task (think of getting from Point A to B in the shortest number of steps).</p>
              <p>In the F2F example, learners use fragments rather than sentences, no longer than four words (Kim, 2017, p. 228). Additionally, all of the spoken utterances are questions, in that in this interaction, the learners were asking only questions back and forth to co-construct this shared information. Kim (2017) observes that this conversation is spoken quickly, as the students are not thinking very hard about their utterances, and observing the “velocity over quality” methodology to accomplish the task.</p>
              <p>In contrast, the SCMC example conversation is significantly more accurate and easy to follow, though Kim (2017) states that this exchange took, on average, a longer time to produce, as SCMC gives students the ability to consider and mediate their responses for a digital platform (p. 231). Additionally, given that these students are not actually together to speak the language in person, Kim (2017) remarks that the learning goals have changed: how might students use their language to eliminate any confusion or need for repetition, to most efficiently complete the task at hand?</p>
              <h5>Connecting Data to Theory</h5>
              <p>The data collected above is further proof of the theory, explained by LaScotte & Tarone (2019) that if a language learner is exposed to varying forms of language across varying social scenarios, their produced language will respond accordingly (p. 96). Consider the above data in relation to the notion of psycholinguistic variability, which refers to (among other factors) the time that the students have to prepare their answers prior to committing their answers “to the record,” (Song, 2020, p. 780). In Example 5, students might perform better, however, the psychological context of SCMC gives them the opportunity to truly think through and prepare their answers, prior to using them (Kim, 2017, p. 231).</p>
              <p>In the discussion of interlanguage and likewise U-shaped development, the learner performance in Example 5 is representative of the initial “top” of the “U” in U-shaped development (Kellerman, 1985, p. 345). This is made evident by the fact that when this psychological context changes, and students attempt to complete the task more quickly, their performance drops (think of descending into the bottom of the “U”) (Kim, 2017, p. 228). In the field of design, this notion is referred to as a “stress-test” – that is, how does a solution perform when it is under stress (time, space, etc.)? In the above examples, you can see the learner's performance break-down as they take less time to answer questions and do not feel the need to get their language exactly right in order to achieve the task at hand.</p>
              <h5>Implications in the Classroom</h5>
              <p>From this perspective, educators should always be particularly aware of the task and mode-type(s) that they employ in the classroom, and more importantly, for assessments. Given the above evidence (Kim, 2017) that shows how F2F and SCMC mode-types impact performance, in that Cheon and Lily perform significantly quicker but less grammatically during a face-to-face (F2F) task, and more grammatically but slower during a synchronous computer-mediated conversational (SCMC) task (pp. 228-231).</p>
              <p>In the case of an entire classroom of learners, versus just two, it is important to consider both task and mode-types when choosing classroom activities and assessments, given the stark variations in learner performance. As this connects back to Ellis&rsquo;s (1992) discussion of psycholinguistic variation (as cited in Song, 2020, p. 780), teachers should be extremely aware of how the classroom setting impacts their students&rsquo; performances, and be able to diversify these activities to truly get a good sense of how the student performs in multiple contexts. Otherwise, the teacher runs a risk of potentially overestimating student language acquisition and moving forward before the student is ready, or underestimating student language acquisition and losing valuable time to repeated lessons, potentially to the detriment of the student.</p>

            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Enacting Heard Speech'>
              <h4>Enacting Heard Speech as an Indicator of Interlanguage</h4>
              <p>The following example, pulled from a study performed by LaScotte and Tarone (2019), demonstrates the changes in fluency as L2 learners narrate a story and “enact” heard speech from their peers. LaScotte and Tarone (2019) found that 90% of analyzed learners demonstrated an increase in fluency, as well as a decrease in hesitation when using their “enacted” voice over their personal narrated speech (p. 104). This is one of multiple examples of enacted voice altering learner speech that is explored by LaScotte & Tarone (2019), including examples of shifts in accuracy (p. 102-104), fluency (p. 104-105), and complexity (p. 105-106).</p>
              <p>	More broadly, each of these data sets contributes to a larger discussion of social context as an indicator of performance and the psycholinguistic phenomenon of “practice” to language change (Song, 2020, p. 780). In the example below, Pasqual enacts a discussion between himself and his grandmother after he comes home from a bar in Spain (where smoking in bars is legal) smelling like marijuana (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 105). LaScotte and Tarone (2019) specifically focus on the improvements to Pasqual&rsquo;s accuracy and fluency in this example (p. 104-105).</p>
              <div class='excerpt-wrap'><img src='MEDIA/Excerpts/grandma.png'/></div>
              <p class='excerpt-note'>(LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 105)</p>
              <h5>Discussion</h5>
              <p>In this dramatic retelling of an encounter with his grandmother, Pasqual takes several opportunities to self-correct as he repeats the “coda” of his story. As in music, Pasqual&rsquo;s coda is a repeated “climax” of his story that he repeats as he retells: this coda, so to speak, is located first on lines 15-16 and then again on lines 22-25 (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 105). What is so striking about this example is that between both codas, LaScotte & Tarone (2019) identify that Pasqual not only self-regulates his profanity, but also self-corrects his misuse of the preposition “for” in the phrase “Grandma! I came here for {th-} the fucking bar!” (p. 105). Additionally, LaScotte and Tarone (2019) posit that given the speakers in this story, the original conversation was not likely spoken in English, so the entire narrative is a translation by Pasqual&rsquo;s own hand (p. 105).</p>
              <p>This particular example demonstrates how language learners are able to self-correct and self-regulate even during prolonged speech (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 105). LaScotte & Tarone (2019) even go so far as to posit that Pasqual&rsquo;s first delivery of the “coda” (lines 15-16) is a rehearsal for his finale in lines 22-25, at which point he flawlessly (and cleanly) delivers his reenactment (p. 105).</p>
              <h5>Connecting Data to Theory</h5>
              <p>This example of self-regulation and self-correction is a great exploration of the topic of psycholinguistic variability, which posits that a learner&rsquo;s interlanguage performance will vary with  more (or less) time to plan their speech (Song, 2020 p. 780). The example of psycholinguistic variability used in the first portion of this report provides the example of spontaneous discussion as an instance where the speaker does not get ample time to prepare their speech before speaking; however, Pasqual&rsquo;s example above (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 105) proves that psycholinguistic variability can occur, even when the speaker does not take a break to silently “prepare” their speech.</p>
              <p>Additionally, Pasqual&rsquo;s conscious removal of any profanity in his return to the “coda” on lines 22-25 (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 105) could be considered a case of “style-shifting” where the speaker subconsciously adds or removes certain stylistic aspects of their speech to better match the social setting (Song, 2020, p. 780). Though one can only guess the reason behind Pasqual&rsquo;s removal of profanity in his “finale” re-enactment, it is possible that this is due to recognition that the speech is being collected for academic purposes, and is not a reflection of a true “casual” conversation (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 105).</p>
              <h5>Implications in the Classroom</h5>
              <p>The outcomes of this study presents a particularly interesting litmus for the classroom: that the concept of “preparation” in psycholinguistic variation does not necessarily need to be silent, but can instead be surfaced through “warm-up” speech. This aligns closely with the notion of private speech where a learner replicates face-to-face speech in conversation with themselves, as a device to mediate their own thinking (Lantolf, Poehner, & Thorne, 2020, p. 227).</p>
              <p>	With this concept in mind (Lantolf et al., 2020, p. 227), teachers have two main opportunities in the classroom: through the concept of oral assessment, give learners opportunities to “practice” or “warm up” their speech prior to assessment. Perhaps in this case, assessment occurs at the end of a class. Additionally, teachers can encourage students to practice self-talk throughout the course of a class, and recognize the change in their language abilities as they grow tenure in speaking aloud.</p>

              <h5>Social context does not always bolster interlanguage development. It can also inhibit it.</h5>
              <p>As we learned from Callahan (2017), internalized cultural values might be a source of motivation for a student to acquire a second language, but can also stand in the way of the student fully acquiring their second language. In the case that the culture surrounding the Native Language (NL) of the learner does not fully accept the Target Language (TL), then it is possible that a student might “backtrack” or permanently fossilize with incorrect or even incomplete TL competence (Callahan, 2017, p. 122).</p>
              <p>Additionally, in the case that the learner has been placed under considerable social or psychological strain as a result of their social environment, their interlanguage development might be limited (Song, 2020, p. 780). This is particularly possible if the student has been encouraged to “perform” their TL in a social setting, where there is a higher likelihood of performance errors that are a result of overthinking or general performance anxiety (Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
              <h5>The impact of social context to interlanguage development can be felt many years after the language is thought to have fossilized.</h5>
              <p>LaScotte & Tarone (2019) posit that interlanguage can “resurge” in social situations that force the speaker to recall these interim forms of language that straddle their native language (NL) and target language (TL) (pp. 97-98). This is also reinforced by Callahan&rsquo;s (2017) study of generational language development in North Town, Texas and Durham, North Carolina. In both instances, Callahan (2017) remarks that changes in language proficiency can be reflection of attitude shifts toward the target language and its associated culture: “from the ‘we versus them&rsquo; mentality of a market minority community… to the more integrated, less bilingual generation which has assimilated to supralocal (English) norms,” (p. 122).</p>
              <h5>While “backtracking” is normal, poor student performance can also be a sign of a strained social situation.</h5>
              <p>Kim (2017) describes how varying task-types (and likewise social situations) can impact learner performance, but Ellis (1992, as cited in Song, 2020) describes a broader and similar situation: psycholinguistic variation (p. 780). Psycholinguistic variation is the main reason why students might display excessive “backtracking” when they do not have time and space to thoroughly prepare their answers (Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
              <p>Additionally, Ellis (1992, as cited in Song, 2020) describes the non-systematic performance variability, which describes numerous situations where students might react abnormally and make mistakes as a direct result of a social situation, in the case of nerves, etc (p. 780). These interlanguage variations can not only be a signal that the learner is in fact learning, but if there are repeated and excessive mistakes, educators should consider altering the social situation to accommodate students and provide them with a more supportive environment where they can accurately display their learning (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779).</p>
              <h5>The development, use, and display of interlanguage ultimately comes down to the learner&rsquo;s motivation and use for the target language (TL).</h5>
              <p>As described in by Tarone (1979, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019) discussion of the “chameleon effect” (p. 96) as well as Kim&rsquo;s (2017) analysis of the correlation between performance and task-type, student display and development of interlanguage is largely inspired by the context and ultimate use of the target language (TL).</p>
              <p>To put this plainly, if a student acquires their TL specifically to work within a factory where they are required to speak very little, and communicate with a small vocabulary only to speak with their coworkers (Language for a Specific Purpose), then their language will be rudimentary in comparison to a student who is acquiring their TL through a class that is designed for full-language immersion and daily socialization. Given that interlanguage specifically represents the bridge between a student&rsquo;s native language (NL) and their TL (Selinker, 1972, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 778), then the interlanguage will vary accordingly.</p>
              <p>In addition, if a student is placed in varying social situations, as the data presented by Kim (2017) above describes, where they perhaps need to achieve a quantity of language over quality language-use, then their interlanguage display will change accordingly (p. 230). Thus, one can presume that if there is repeated need for one of these task-types over another, then this interlanguage will be further internalized as the student gains additional context to this unique form of language.</p>

            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Outstanding Questions'>
              <h4>Outstanding Questions</h4>
              <h5>What role does “standardized” language play, in support or opposition to interlanguage variability?</h5>
              <p>LaScotte and Tarone (2019) describe the impact of social context as the force that can drive new “dimensions” of interlanguage – that if a learner is exposed to different variations of a language across varying social situations, then they will “style-shift” to match their linguistic environment (p. 96). This phenomenon, which LaScotte and Tarone (2019) describe as the “chameleon effect'' is commonly used to describe how a student might speak language differently in a social versus academic environment.</p>
              <p>Given this information, and the tradition of lawmakers to “standardize” language-use in academic contexts (Wardaugh & Fuller, 2015, p. 35), what pressures do educators feel to prioritize “standardized” language as the “right way” to do language versus the language variations that students might pick up from varying social situations?</p>
              <h5>How might we prime our L2 learners for academic success, knowing that social context plays such a large role in their developing interlanguage?</h5>
              <p>As part of the above conversation about “standardized” language development, and with the knowledge that varying social situations bring their own flavor of language use to a learner&rsquo;s developing interlanguage, what possible steps can educators take to make a distinction between academic versus social language use? Is this a necessary step to take in order to encourage students&rsquo; own academic success, and is it possible to do this without impacting their confidence or developed abilities?</p>

              <h5>What responsibility do educators have to “intervene” if they feel that the surrounding social context of a student&rsquo;s target language is going to inhibit their progress?</h5>
              <p>As was made evident by Callahan&rsquo;s (2017) analysis of Hispanic communities and the variations by which students who speak Spanish as their native language (NL), community sentiment toward heritage and the role of language as part of the preservation of culture can both encourage and inhibit second language development. Given these findings, under what circumstances can and should educators intervene if the cultural perception of the target language (TL) by the NL-speaking group is actually inhibiting student language development? In addition to this question, should it be the responsibility of the educator to intervene in this case, or can we consider this natural resistance to developing the TL a variation to interlanguage, and simply let this tendency “run its course”?</p>

              <h4>Experiences as a Language Learner</h4>
              <p>In my experience as a language learner, I have felt first-hand the implications that are discussed by researchers throughout this analysis of interlanguage variation. For clarity&rsquo;s sake, I have broken my own experiences as a language learner down via the traditional categorization of interlanguage variability:</p>
              <h5>Systematic Variability</h5>
              <p>Within the realm of systemic variability, my experiences as a language learner have largely reflected my own language change as a result of psycholinguistic variability. I find, similar to the data collected by Kim (2017) above, that my own performance tends to falter as I use my foreign language (FL) skills in scenarios that limit my ability to “prepare” to use my own speech.</p>
              <p>In my own experience learning Italian, I find that when I am fully “present” and can take the time and space to speak the language without fear of social pressures to speak quickly,  then I tend to perform more accurately. These days, my score in Duolingo exams averages approximately 93% accuracy (a number I have pulled from my own experience, this is not formally collected data). In contrast, in circumstances where I feel either rushed to move through the lessons quickly, my accuracy tends to go down and my median score is closer to 85%.</p>
              <h5>Non-Systematic Variability</h5>
              <p>Similarly, my experiences in non-systematic variability reflect more the influence of performance variability on my own development. Personally, I find that in my experience learning Italian via Duolingo, my performance tends to wane when my spouse or family is in the room as I practice. This type of “presentation” means that I double-check and often overthink my answers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Recommended Impact to Education'>
              <h4>Recommended Impact to Education</h4>
              <p>Each of the following recommendations relies on a common denominator: awareness. As teachers, learners, and educators, the strongest tool that we can leverage is our awareness of interlanguage variation and the impact of social context on interlanguage. There are, of course, a number of variations that we can knowingly manipulate to serve our educational or research goals, however we must be aware that each of us, as students or teachers, comes with our own unique social contexts and variations to our own styles.</p>
              <h5>Impact to Teaching</h5>
              <p>As described throughout the many sections of this work, educators have a unique opportunity to transcend the role of both learner, educator, and researcher, in that they may recognize the impact of certain social contexts and interlanguage variables on their learners, and adjust the curriculum accordingly. This is also an opportunity to act as a researcher, as the educator can turn any number of unique “knobs” to suit the social constraints of their learners and likewise the learners&rsquo; educational goals and test a number of hypotheses on various mode-types (Kim, 2017), social situations (Song, 2020, p. 780), and more, to encourage the development of the learner&rsquo;s interlanguage.</p>
              <p>Likewise, it should go without saying that if the educator has the ability to manipulate the social or educational situation to suit the goals of the learner and the growth of their interlanguage (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779), then the educator should also be aware and sensitive to the language (Xu, 2019) and social (Callahan, 2017) situations that students might encounter outside of the classroom.</p>
              <h5>Impact to Learning</h5>
              <p>Similarly to the description of variables within an educational setting, above, learners who are aware of the social impacts to their interlanguage and ultimately language development, have an opportunity to harness this self-awareness and leverage their social contexts and variables to suit their own education (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779). This is a particularly powerful tool, as it encourages learner autonomy outside of the classroom, and empowers learners to take control of their own educational journey, without simply being at the mercy of the educator. As Corder (1967) once remarked: “We cannot really teach language, we can only create conditions in which it will develop spontaneously in the mind in its own way,” (p. 169).</p>
              <h5>Impact to Research</h5>
              <p>In the way that educators have an opportunity to manipulate the education setting and social contexts of lessons and assessment within the classroom (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779), researchers must be particularly aware of the potential interlanguage variations that might exist for a learner set, and acknowledge these as variables within their own research. That is, the researcher must acknowledge that given that these variables exist, their research will never be completely “sterile” or free of outside influence, as each learner brings their own unique “baggage” to the learning and assessment scenarios (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779).</p>
              <p>That said, I believe that there are numerous opportunities within the field of interlanguage variation for additional research. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Interlanguage development on migrant communities</li>
                <li>Interlanguage development in the context of language for a specific purpose (LSP)</li>
                <li>Interlanguage “backtracking” as second-language speakers return to learner communities</li>
              </ul>

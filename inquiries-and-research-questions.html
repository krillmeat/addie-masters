          <div class='sub-section' data-heading='How does social context influence the development of a learner’s interlanguage?'>
            <p>In his work to define and elucidate on the topic of interlanguage variability, Ellis (1992, as cited in Song, 2020, pp. 779-781) created the model of interlanguage variability, which breaks the topic down to two categories: systematic and non-systematic variability:</p>
            <h4>Systematic Variability</h4>
            <p>Within the realm of systematic variability, both situational and psycholinguistic contexts are largely a reflection of social factors to the development of interlanguage (Song, 2020, p. 780). Situational context refers to the continuum that accounts for “style-shifting” &mdash; that is, the scenarios by which learners feel they should more or less accurately perform based on the context of the language use (Song, 2020, p. 780). Psycholinguistic variability refers to those various situations that allow learners for more (or less) time and planning to produce language (Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
            <p>An example of this is a controlled classroom setting, where students have a lengthy time to prepare their speech before using it, versus a spontaneous discussion with another speaker of the target language, on the street. The first scenario creates a much larger opportunity for students to plan and anticipate their language use than the second, which likely would reveal greater accuracy in the classroom than on the street.</p>
            <h4>Non-Systematic Variability</h4>
            <p>Non-systematic variability accounts for those variations in interlanguage development that appear to occur at random in student performance &mdash; these are phenomena like random mistakes and performance variability (Song, 2020, p. 780). Performance variability describes the errors in speech that learners can make as a result of social pressures and accompanying student variations that reflect varying levels of discomfort in displaying knowledge and thus “performing” in front of an audience (Song, 2020, p. 780). These factors include slips of the tongue, changes of mind, and more (Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
          </div>
          <div class='sub-section' data-heading='Significance to Education'>
            <p>Tarone’s (1982, as cited in Song, 2020) application of this logic suggests that educators should be aware of how the social context might impact student performance, and create a variety of social situations for students to interact in, in order to expand their interlanguage (p. 779). Additionally, in the pursuit of a variety, teachers should pay extra attention to how their students are responding to such situations, in order to “check and adjust” their methods to fit the learner's needs (Song, 2020, pp. 781-782).</p>
            <p>This understanding of social context as a key factor in student progress represents a historical shift from language learning as being learner agnostic, in the case of behaviorist theory, gradually toward attention to the learner as main change agent in their own L2 development (Larsen-Freeman, 2019, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96). This paves the way for new and exciting developments in how learners can acquire language, and additions to the pedagogical toolkit for encouraging language development, such as in the case of exemplar-based learning (Ellis & Wulff, 2020) as described below.</p>

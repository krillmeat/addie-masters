            <p>Given the general concept of interlanguage as a bridge between a learner&rsquo;s L1 and L2, interlanguage variability refers to the times in interlanguage development where the linguistic “rules” of the L1 and L2 are in conflict, and the learner might use multiple different variations of language to express the same phenomenon (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 779). This can be considered similarly to the saying “there are multiple paths to the top of the mountain.”</p>
            <p>The notion here is that a learner&rsquo;s interlanguage is a very personal construction: even if two learners start with the same Native Language (NL) and are aiming at the same Target Language (TL), it is not certain that their interlanguages (IL) throughout the learning process will be even remotely similar. This is explained largely by the impact of social context to the development of this interlanguage (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96). That is, should the language learner be exposed to different forms of language, in different sequences, or in different social situations, their produced language might vary significantly as they respond to these external factors (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96).</p>
            <p>A good example of the social context of speech impacting interlanguage variation is a learner performing in a planned verbal assessment for a language class versus a learner speaking with friends in their TL, during a day outing. Of course, these are two drastically different social contexts and each presents their own unique form of variation to the linguistic display.</p>
            <p>In the case of the planned verbal assessment, such factors as psychological context (referring to the time that the learner has to prepare their speech before speaking) (Song, 2020, p. 780) and situational context (referring to the formality of a standardized assessment) (Song, 2020, p. 780) vary significantly from an outing with friends. Thus if the learner is attempting to make a point about the weather, their interlanguage (given that they have not fully mastered the L2) might be more artificial and “accurate” in the case of a formal assessment, and more expressive (colloquial), expansive, and “inaccurate” during an outing with friends (Tarone, 1982, as cited in Song, 2020, p. 780).</p>
            <p>Tarone (1979, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96) initially explained this as a “chameleon” phenomenon, in which the language learner cannot control the way that they shift styles in order to match the linguistic environment in which they&rsquo;ve been placed. However, Larsen-Freeman (2019, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019) questions learner agency &mdash; in which learners knowingly and intentionally alter their speech and linguistic style to either match or stand out from their linguistic environment (p. 96).</p>
            <p>While the adoption of certain styles of language might be intentional, unbeknownst to these learners, they are continually internalizing this information as part of their interlanguage (Lantolf & Beckett, 2009, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 97). That is, Lantolf & Beckett (2009, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019) posit that learners do not acquire language in a vacuum, like sterile language skills within a textbook, but instead that learners integrate the skills themselves as well as the social contexts, features, and styles associated with those skills into their interlanguage (p. 97).  This notion is similar to the feeling of nostalgia &mdash; the idea that a song or film might “take you back” &mdash; similarly a learner might resurrect social contexts or learned styles of language as associated with their developing interlanguage (LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 97-98).</p>

            <p>Tarone’s (1982, as cited in Song, 2020) application of this logic suggests that educators should be aware of how the social context might impact student performance, and create a variety of social situations for students to interact in, in order to expand their interlanguage (p. 779). Additionally, in the pursuit of a variety, teachers should pay extra attention to how their students are responding to such situations, in order to “check and adjust” their methods to fit the learner's needs (Song, 2020, pp. 781-782).</p>
            <p>This understanding of social context as a key factor in student progress represents a historical shift from language learning as being learner agnostic, in the case of behaviorist theory, gradually toward attention to the learner as main change agent in their own L2 development (Larsen-Freeman, 2019, as cited in LaScotte & Tarone, 2019, p. 96). This paves the way for new and exciting developments in how learners can acquire language, and additions to the pedagogical toolkit for encouraging language development, such as in the case of exemplar-based learning (Ellis & Wulff, 2020) as described below.</p>
